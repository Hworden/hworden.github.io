Currently, I am a Lead Software Engineer and have a track record leading numerous large-scale projects from proof of concept to final delivery. I have led these projects in both technical and project management capacities. On the technical front, I spearhead the software architecture and design of these projects and communicate them across the organization taking into consideration both functional and nonfunctional requirements of the system.</description></item></channel></rss>
