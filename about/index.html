Currently, I am a Lead Software Engineer and have a track record leading numerous large-scale projects from proof of concept to final delivery. I have led these projects in both technical and project management capacities. On the technical front, I spearhead the software architecture and design of these projects and communicate them across the organization taking into consideration both functional and nonfunctional requirements of the system. Additionally, I actively play a technical mentorship role by increasing the knowledge and scope of the engineers on my team, but also more broadly across the organization. On the project management front, I lead grooming and planning sessions on a bi-weekly basis for the team working hand in hand with product management to properly sequence work and ensure technical concerns are accounted for in the planning process.</p><p>In my free time I enjoy working on side projects. My latest one is <a href="https://app.meetproppy.ai/vendor/search?query=buildings&page=1&pageSize=10">meetproppy.ai</a> (still a work in progress!).</p><figure><img src=/images/posts/about/meetproppy.png width=500px></figure><h2 id=education>Education

<a class=heading-link href=#self-service-ivr><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h5><p>Built a no-code interactive voice response workflow builder. This was a large (quarter long project) and highly visible project for the company. I was the tech lead for this and led 3 other engineers on it. This project was completely greenfield to the company and initially there were a lot of unknowns, from basic implementation of the project to what we had to build next sprint üòÖ.</p><p>Despite the magnitude of the project and technical hurdles we had to clear, we were largely successful in launching the product on schedule.
Reflecting back on this, here&rsquo;s what went right:</p><ul><li>Acknowledging unknowns and kicking off spikes as <em>early as possible</em>.</li><li>Using spikes to do <em>real</em> proofs of concept and only start <em>forecasting a project plan afterwards</em>. I personally did the proof of concept for this project and it gave enough insight to forecast about a month out. I addressed key assumptions head on and built prior art that was more useful than external docs.</li><li>Identifying key areas of the product that <em>others</em> can own. Projects of this size <em>have</em> to be team efforts, which means the team needs to share in the ownership, so simply identifying and encouraging each team member to own a separate part of the code can go a long way.</li></ul><h5 id=custom-contact-lists>Custom Contact Lists

This was a particularly challenging project for a variety of reasons:</p><ul><li>Bringing in new technology to the company that no one had experience using</li><li>Trying to reason around nuances in our platform</li><li>The implementation itself was technically challenging and required in-depth knowledge of our entire platform</li></ul><p>It was a formative experience for myself personally, and I still apply learnings from this project to projects today.
