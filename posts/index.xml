I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been learning about &amp;ldquo;Building in Public&amp;rdquo; and central to it is to maintain constant communication with the public. I thought that it would be great if I could post links to my personal site on Twitter. That way my followers could instantly see any new updates I&amp;rsquo;ve made.</description></item><item><title>My New Site</title><link>https://hworden.github.io/posts/my-new-site/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hworden.github.io/posts/my-new-site/</guid><description>Intro Hi everyone, this is my first post on my new site. So welcome! I was able to build this site in less than an hour using Hugo.
Hugo Summary For those who may not know, Hugo is a static site generator. You can store your site content in markdown files, and then apply either a custom or open source theme to your site. Hugo will then take the content files, and translate them to equivalent html pages.</description></item></channel></rss>
